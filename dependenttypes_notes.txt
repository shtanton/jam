Static dependent type checking isn't decidable so it needs to be restricted
Restrictions around dependent types that other languages have:
- Only total functions are programmable (agda)
- Only for checking certain constraints like array bound checking (xi, pfenning)
- Only types representable as total refinement types are programmable

Dependent types are definitely not what I want to use
