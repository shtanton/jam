I explore possibilities for implementing a compiler for a typed lambda calculus which makes use of
refinement types.
The compiler takes as input a program, and uses a combination of standard, well-tested compiler techniques
with some recent developments in formal verification to type check the program and produce an executable.
Refinement types allow properties of the program to be specified using types and formally proven at
compile time to prevent a wide class of bugs.
Properties are specified by refining types to restrict the set of values which a variable will be
able to take when the program runs.
By making it impossible for certain states to occur, we can know a program works with a much higher
degree of certainty than we could ever achieve with unit tests.
My compiler uses the Z3 SMT solver to either prove that a program is sound, or to find a counterexample
showing a possible environment in which the value wouldn't be allowed by the type.
Finally it generates an executable using LLVM allowing the verified program to be run.
